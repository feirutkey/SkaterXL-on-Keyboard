# SkaterXL on Keyboard (GUIDE)

Knowing that you NEED an controller to play this game, i was determined to play with keyboard after my controller broke, but i still do not recommend it, you gonna need to tweak to your playstyle, even if you're playing with my config.
It's hard, you gonna have patience, at the same time you had to make your stats or atleast edit the stats you gather from other guys, its the same thing, but atleast is a new challenge!

## What you need to know

You gonna need to use reWASD to remap your keyboard to a controller, keep that in mind, some functions they're really hard to execute, so if you have any update, send me a dm on discord!

### Prerequisites + Installation

reWASD - The latest build is on their website, you can follow up by [this link](https://www.rewasd.com/) (just to remember, im not affiliated with them or any software)


## Installing

Install reWASD and restart your pc, so the driver will load up and get the virtual mapping working properly.
After that, don't open it, yet!

## Using the Config


You can download this `basic config` that i've made [here](https://www.mediafire.com/file/fxpbbvcf7js59sf/Skater_XL.rar/file), its really easy so you can setup each key by your own later.
After that, go to yours Local Disk C/Users/Public/Documents/reWASD/Profiles and paste in there, so when you open reWASD you can load it up!


Now you can open reWASD!

### Hotkeys

The hotkeys aren't hard to understand, but for you that doesnt understand about computer, this will be a complete guide on all of it.

+ WASD (Left Stick)
	- W = Left Stick UP / A = Left Stick LEFT / S = Left Stick DOWN / D = Left Stick RIGHT 
	- `If you hold Left Shift + W/A/S/D it will make the sensitivity slower (not using 100% of the stick, so you can manual with it)`
+ Arrow Keys (Right Stick) 
	- UP = Right Stick UP / LEFT = Right Stick LEFT / Down = Right Stick DOWN / Right = Right Stick RIGHT
	- `Same thing, if you hold Right Shift + UP/LEFT/DOWN/RIGHT it will make the sensitivity slower (not using 100% of the stick, so you can manual with it)`
+ Left Ctrl (Left Trigger)
+ Right Ctrl (Right Trigger)
+ Left Alt (Left Foot Catch/Bump)
+ Right Alt (Right Foot Catch/Bump)
+ Z (Y on Controller)
+ X (B on Controller)
+ Numpad-1 (A on Controller)
+ / (X on Controller)
+ V (Start on Controller)
+ C (Select on Controller)
+ 1234 (D-PAD)
	- 1 = UP D-Pad / 2 = DOWN D-Pad / 3 = RIGHT D-Pad / 4 = Left D-PAD
	- To be `easier` for you guys movement on the map and record clips

## Quick Tip

An issue that i was heaving was with the realistic catch (i can't use auto-catch, its ugly as hell), sometimes your keys could bug! So i highly recommend by pressing both catch keys at the same time, or bind 1 key to the 2 commands `EXAMPLE: LAlt to L3+R3`

## Mute Keys

Remember to `mute all the keys that you're using` or some mod bindings **gonna conflict**, and thats a big problem if you're playing SXL.
